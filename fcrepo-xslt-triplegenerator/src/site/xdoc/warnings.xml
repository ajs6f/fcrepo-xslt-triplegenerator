                This is an experimental module for the Fedora Commons repository framework.
                Please, <i>please</i> don't use it on a production repository without very
                thorough testing. Misusing this component (particularly see <a href="xslt.html">here</a>) could damage your
                Resource Index to the point where only a complete rebuild can restore order.
                Those of us with large repositories will shudder at the thought.
            </p>
            <p>
                The triples you extract and add to the Resource Index using this module will not be visible
                or modifiable by the normal Fedora API methods and they will not appear in RELS-EXT or RELS-INT.
                You might think of them as being "orthogonal" to those explicitly-recorded relationships. They will
                only exist in the Resource Index and can only be used by services and workflows that use the RI.
