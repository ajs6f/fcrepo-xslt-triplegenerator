            <p>
                Many of us would like to engage the flexibility of the RDF metamodel,
                but we have enormous investment in XML metadata. The cost of rebuilding workflows and
                tools is too high to be paid all at once. Using this tool, you can extract assertions 
                from XML metadata and get them into the Fedora Resource Index, while still maintaining
                the XML metadata as the authoritative record. This is a way of dipping your toes into
                the RDF sea without getting in over your head.
